		HATop is an interactive ncurses client and real-time monitoring,
		statistics displaying tool for the HAProxy TCP/HTTP load balancer.

		HATop's appearance is similar to top(1). It supports various modes for
		detailed statistics of all configured proxies and services in near
		realtime. In addition, it features an interactive CLI for the haproxy
		unix socket. This allows administrators to control the given haproxy
		instance (change server weight, put servers into maintenance mode, ...)
		directly out of hatop (using keybinds or the CLI) and monitor the
		results immediately.
