HATop is an interactive ncurses client for the HAProxy stats socket
===================================================================

It's appearance is similar to top(1). HATop supports various modes for
detailed statistical display of all configured proxies and their servers
in near realtime. In addition, it features a simple command line client
for the unix socket. This way the admin may control the given haproxy
instance (change server weight, put servers into maintenance mode, ...)
in a single place and monitor the results immediately.
